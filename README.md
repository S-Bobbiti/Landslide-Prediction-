# Landslide-Prediction-
The Project titled 'Landslide Prediction using Deep-Learning Frameworks and WSN' compares two methods for landslide prediction.

In this project I utilized satellite images from landslide4sense dataset from IARAI [https://www.iarai.ac.at/landslide4sense/challenge/] and performed mapping using a deep learning based image segmentation model U-Net to detect landslides and make predictions on unseen data.

Collaborated with two other students and designed a sensor network with multiple working nodes, to sense the soil moisture and movement in real-time in a given area for landslide prediction. The process of data collection from these sensors to the base station was also studied. 

Compared and reported the results, advantages, and shortcomings of landslide prediction using the above-mentioned methodologies in IEEE format.
